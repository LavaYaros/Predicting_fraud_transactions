This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions through data analysis and machine learning. The methodology includes:

- Data Preparation: Merging transaction and customer datasets, handling missing values, and defining variable types.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing distributions, detecting correlations, and identifying significant predictors.
- Feature Engineering: Creating interaction variables, normalizing numerical data, and encoding categorical variables.
- Statistical Testing: Performing t-tests and chi-square tests to validate feature significance.
- Model Development: Implementing logistic regression with cross-validation, evaluating performance using accuracy, precision, and recall.
- Model Optimization: Iteratively selecting predictors to balance sensitivity and specificity for fraud detection.

The final model prioritizes either recall (fraud detection sensitivity), precision (reducing false positives), or a balanced approach based on business needs.
